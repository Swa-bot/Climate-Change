<h2>What is Climate Change?</h2>
<p class = "Info">Climate change can essentially be described as the increase in Earth's climate due to an excess of green house gases. Green house gases are <strong class="highlight">water vapour</strong>, <strong class="highlight" id ="CO2">carbon dioxide</strong>, <strong class="highlight" id="N2O">nitrous oxide</strong>, and <strong class="highlight" id="CH4">methane</strong>. These are called "green house" gases because they trap the sun's energy and radiate it (creating a green house like effect) and heating up the Earth (hence the name "climate change").</p>

<h3 title = "Anthropogenic means human related">Some Anthropogenic Activities Increasing Climate Change:</h3>
<ul class="Info"><a onmouseover='show_hide()'>
<li><strong class="highlight">Driving Gasoline-Powered Vehicles</strong>-This results in a surplus of CO2 (Carbon Dioxide) due to the gas emissions.</li>
<li><strong class="highlight">Deforestation</strong>-Trees absorb a large sum of CO2 in the air so when trees get cut down, there are fewer trees and plants to absorb the CO2.</li>
<li><strong class="highlight">Overconsumption</strong>-Over consumption is an incredibly significant cause of not only climate change but also pollution, habitat loss, and much more. Many resources<br> are acquired to make even a single product putting a dent<br> in the ecosystem and releasing many green house gases in the course of its production.</li>
<li id="extraInfo"><strong class="highlight">Livestock Farming and Agriculture</strong>-Livestock farming and agriculture take up a lot of land especially as the population increases. You might be thinking, when we take up land for agriculture, aren't we planting more plants which helps curb the release of CO2? The answer would be no. This is because trees absorb much more CO2 than plants but take up about the same space (considering the TOTAL land required for agriculture). </li>
